## Small Decimal

```
yarn small-decimal
```

Not the big decimal library that you are looking for.

It supports decimals with 32 bits of floating precision and arbitrary integer precision.

It only has a handful of operations. Has no support for Infinity or NaN.

Library is very lightweight it relies heavily on BigInt.
